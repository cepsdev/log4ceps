log4kmw demo
========

Small application demonstrating:
- the usage of log specifications and the logspec2cpp tool
- the log4kmw Logging API
- their common usage in a program writing log entries
- the default log reader.  

INSTALL
=====


Open a shell and change the working directory to log4kmw/def2cpp,
and type the following (builds log2cpp):
 make

After successful completion of the first step change the working directory to the folder 
where this file is located in , and type the following command:

../../def2cpp/x86_linux64bit/logspec2cpp ./log_spec/base.def ./log_spec/log_specification.def -o./generated_files

After successful completion of this step type the following command:

 make

RUN
===
After successful completion of the first step change the working directory to the folder 
where this file is located in. Type

 ./demo

A prompt appears asking you for some text input, enter some text and hit RETURN.
You can repeat this procedure by typing text whenever the prompt appears or terminate 
the application by typing 'quit' (followed by RETURN). Before the application terminates it prints
the content of the generated logfile.

If the shell prompt appears type

 ./reader demo_logbook.bin

'reader' is the default reader application for logs which is automatically generated by the log2spec tool (it is located in 'log4kmw_default_log_reader.cpp').
